# Stack and Queue

Stack and Queue are similar data structures.

#### Stack : LIFO (Last in Fast out)
#### Queue : FIFO (First in First out)

## Stack
Stack has a pointer called ''TOP to check the last element in the stack.
Operations insert, pop.


## Queue

Queue has two pointer FRONT and REAR.
FRONT check the front element that are still reamaining in the Queue and REAR check the last element that is added into the Queue.

Operatoions `enqueue`, `dequeue` are available.

```js 
deque
shift in js
```


Stack can be written any type of data structure arrays or linked list.
But Linked list is perfer to use for Queue to avoid so many data index shifting.
