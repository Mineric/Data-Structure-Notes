# What is Data Struture?

Data structure is a collection of values. 
Those values may have relationship among them or functions among them.



` Data structure + algorithms = Program `




Data structure is all about arrangement of data. We can define how to interact with data that is stored  and how it is  arranged in RAM.

* Our goal is to optimize the way that those information accessed from CPU.

# Basic operations 

* Insertion
* Deletion
* Traversal (accessing each data once inside data structure.)
* Searching (location of data item if it is existed inside the collections of items)
* Sorting
* Access (how to we access from computer. May be most important one.)


#### Searching
Know the item value and search that inside the data collection. But donâ€™t know where it is. 
So find each and then found tell the location (index).

#### Accessing
Search the item inside the collection. Know where it is. (any method, index or location).
Find by that index or any method. And return value
